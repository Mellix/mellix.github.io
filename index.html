      <p>When I'm not traveling, I like going out and hanging out with my friends!
        I also enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and working out.
        I often spend my time at home, but more recently, I've been going out more
        frequently to exercise and exploring the areas near my home! It's a nice experience
        and I've never been so happy in my life (:</p>
      <p> I am currently 17; my birthday is on April 30th. I'm going to be a senior
        this upcoming school year at American Indian Public High School. Honestly
        very nervous about it, but I can't wait to end the year with my friends!
        I value my relationships dearly and I hope I can maintain them throughout
        the year!
